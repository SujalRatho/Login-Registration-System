#In this project module, we explored The Login & Registration System program in C++. We learned how to implement Class, Object, if-else and switch and created login system for security and privacy for a user. With this knowledge we can create more complex projects which can help in banking purposes etc.

A secure and user-friendly Login and Registration System in C++ can be designed and implemented by considering the necessary components such as user interface design, server-side validation, password encryption, user authentication, and user authorization.
